just drop the Pocketmine-MP folder with source in the folder with this Programm or just start it and use one of its 2 preset options
1 => Pocketmine from PMMP
2 => NetherGamesMC PocketMineMP with build in Multiversion

else just drop the Pocketmine-MP (or PocketMine-MP-stable) folder in the same folder this programm is located in

Requires Composer

(Caution: this tool sets automatically IS_DEVELOPMENT_BUILD to false)
(with the drop and play you could basically build your own coded pmmp version too :D)
(It is recommended to copy the bin folder from your pocketmine server folder (the windows one) also to the folder this programm is located, this will make sure the programm wont run into bugs)
(when Composer asks for a Github AuthO key, put it in and rerun this code in an new opened cmd window)
(Currently only Windows Supported)
